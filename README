==Structure of the fork==

Master contains clean revesions of NPOI from http://npoi.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

Brunches named patched_REV are created from some revision (REV) of master. Some fixes may be added in patched_REV.

==How to get last changes from official NPOI?==

1. Checkout master
2. Execute svn update on trunk directory.
3. Commit to master with comment "revision number REV"
4. Make the branch named "patched_REV" from previous patched_REV
5. Rebase just created patched_REV onto HEAD of master
6. Compile. Run tests. Commit. Push branch to server. Voila!
